Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases.

### Pros
- Works with Web Experience Toolkit
- Allows both HTML and JSX templates for view
- Good Documentation
- Official packages for state management (vuex), routing (vue-router), server-side rendering (vue-server-renderer), means tight integration with Vue
- Official Tools (Vue CLI, Vue DevTools) have tight integration with official packages. (ex: state transform history/inspection when using Vuex)
- Progressive framework means it's easy to integrate with legacy systems
- *Subjective* Easy learning curve
- Vetur plugin for Visual Studio Code

### Cons
- Official Tools don't integrate with other popular packages. 
- Not as popular as React.js so less experience with devs
- Not a large ecosystem
